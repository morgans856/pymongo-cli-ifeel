# Context
This app is my first project from my Big Data training, and my first time programming anything.
The requirements were that the application must perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality 
with data stored in a database. The application should have a CLI where users can interact with the application while it is running.
Other than those requirements, the type of application was up to me.
