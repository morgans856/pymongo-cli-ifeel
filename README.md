# About
This app is my first project from my Big Data Engineering training. The requirements were that the application must perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with data stored in a MongoDB database. The application should have a CLI where users can interact with the application while it is running. Other than those requirements, the type of application was up to me.
